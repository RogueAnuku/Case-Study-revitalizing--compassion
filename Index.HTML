          <p >Four different designs were created for the homepage. The team then discussed the best aspects of each wireframe. We then moved forward with choosing one of the designs and incorporating features we liked from others. After that, we designed the additional flows and utalized site mapping. The result of our sitemapping yeilded the addition of a search bar, user login, and an active donate link so users can donate at any time. Lo-fi prototypes were created and a UI style guide. </p>

        <h2>Step Five: Test</h2>
          <p >The testing was conducted remotely, involving a moderated usability study with seven participants. They were given four tasks to assess our redesigned sitemap and user flows. Our findings indicated that 60% of the participants preferred having the 'About Us' section included in the primary navigation bar rather than the secondary navigation links, as originally designed. In response to this valuable feedback, we made the necessary changes and incorporated the About section into the primary navigation bar. Another significant insight we gained from the study is the crucial importance of users being aware that they are on an official not-for-profit webpage. This is particularly crucial for volunteers and donors, as it builds trust and encourages their involvement. To achieve this, easy access to the About Us section was identified as a vital step in establishing the organization's credibility and reliability.</p>
